Here's a comprehensive checklist from our entire conversation:

ESSENTIAL FIXES:
- [ ] Fix typo: "must of which" → "most of which" in LLMs/Transformers section
- [ ] Add "2024" to December morning run
- [ ] Break up long CRISPR sentence about chronological logs
- [ ] Change "The Attention Tax" to "The Bitter Pill" (section title + TOC + anchor)

KEY CITATIONS TO ADD:
- [ ] Wei et al. 2022 for first "Let's think step by step" mention
- [ ] Merrill & Sabharwal for TC0 limitations
- [ ] Sutton's bitter lesson essay
- [ ] Turing 1936 for computation foundations
- [ ] Guan et al. for o3's MCMC approach
- [ ] Sadremomtaz for CRISPR memory
- [ ] Kaplan et al. for scaling laws
- [ ] "Were RNNs All We Needed?" paper
- [ ] Turing's reaction-diffusion theory
- [ ] Liu et al. for chain-of-thought limitations
- [ ] Meta Llama 3 technical paper (if available)
- [ ] Merrill & Sabharwal 2024 on transformer expressivity with chain of thought

FIGURE IMPROVEMENTS:
- [ ] Add axes description to quadratic scaling figure caption
- [ ] Check all image attributions/copyrights

LINK VERIFICATION:
- [ ] Verify all URLs resolve correctly
- [ ] Check xAI/Colossus news links are stable
- [ ] Ensure paper links use consistent format

OPTIONAL REFINEMENTS:
- [ ] Add transition before Herculaneum image
- [ ] Consider italicizing key terms on first use (e.g., _TC0_)
- [ ] Review section transitions for flow
- [ ] Check anchor tag consistency throughout

MINOR TWEAKS:

- [ ] For universal computation/AGI equivalence, you could add a brief clarification when you first connect them:
```markdown
So augmented with bronze age technology, we become "universal" computers in Turing's language—the quintessential "general" intelligence capable of solving any problem given enough time and snacks. For the sake of argument, let's agree: general intelligence ≈ universal computer. (After all, if you can simulate any computation, you can solve any well-defined problem.)
```

- [ ] For the CRISPR transition, perhaps:
```markdown
But the truth is, generality doesn't require a quadratic cost. Nature shows us why. Look at a single cell.
```

- [ ] For MCMC, you could add a brief parenthetical:
```markdown
"forest of thought", MCMC sampled chains-of-thought (exploring multiple possible reasoning paths like a chess computer) which are kept in check.
```
